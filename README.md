# Lost in Assets

This is a university team project that consisted of designing, implementing, and optimizing a database about a specific topic. The project language is Italian. Specifically, we started by identifying the key entities within the financial domain and designed the ER schema with normalization roles. We then filled the SQL database with massive data and tested the system on tens of queries. Some queries were coniderably inefficient, so we also optimized them with indexes and hints.
